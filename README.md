# Hi there, I'm [Your Name] 👋

### 👨‍💻 AI Researcher & Full-Stack Engineer at DI Solution

I am a researcher and engineer who bridges the gap between **Generative AI**, **Structured Knowledge**, and **Business Strategy**. My expertise lies not only in developing intelligent systems using LLMs and Knowledge Graphs but also in **planning and proposing** viable R&D roadmaps that solve real-world problems.

I possess a unique blend of **Academic Rigor** (Papers, GNN, Time-series) and **Product Vision** (Service Planning, Proposal Writing), allowing me to lead projects from conceptualization to deployment.

### 🔭 Research & Technical Focus

**Current Focus**
* **LLM Orchestration & Agentic Workflow:** Designing complex interaction flows using **n8n** and **ComfyUI**.
* **Knowledge Graph-based RAG:** Integrating unstructured text with structured ontologies (GraphRAG) for precision.
* **Spatial & Time-Series Intelligence:** Analyzing urban spatial data (GIS) and forecasting trends using **ARIMA/Prophet**.

**Previous Research**
* **Knowledge Tracing & Concept Map Generation:** Automated extraction of Knowledge Components (KC) from educational videos (SpeeKG, CONREC).
* **Cognitive & Sentiment Analysis:** Modeling user responses (Significance, Subjectivity, Sentiment) in video content.
* **Industrial Anomaly Detection:** Applying GNNs and Root Causal Analysis for manufacturing processes.

### 💡 Strategic Planning & Proposal (R&D Logic)
I specialize in translating complex technical concepts into persuasive proposals and actionable business plans.

* **R&D Proposal & Grant Writing:**
    * Successfully authored and structured research proposals for government-funded projects (e.g., NRF grants).
    * Defined research hypotheses, methodologies (GNN, Ontology), and expected outcomes for **Digital Literacy (SilverLearn)** and **Industrial AI** projects.
* **Service & Product Planning:**
    * Designed user scenarios and business models for the **SilverLearn** platform (Senior EdTech).
    * Developed service architectures for **Social Media Sharing** platforms, focusing on user interaction and content distribution.
* **Data-Driven Decision Making:**
    * Conducted **Inventory Optimization Analysis** using **ARIMA models** to forecast appropriate stock levels, demonstrating the ability to apply statistical models to business logistics.
    * Established robust **Data Preprocessing Pipelines** to ensure data integrity for downstream ML tasks.
